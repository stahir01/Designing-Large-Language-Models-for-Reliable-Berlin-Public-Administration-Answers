# Berlin Public Administration Chatbot using Large Language Models

## Overview

This project was undertaken as part of Project Data Science SS23 at Technische Universit√§t Berlin. The primary objective of the project was to develop a reliable and efficient chatbot system tailored for addressing public administration-related queries specific to Berlin. Leveraging the existing database utilized by the "Bobby" chatbot on the official Berlin.de website, the project aimed to enhance user experiences by providing accurate and timely information through state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Objectives

- Utilize the database used by the "Bobby" chatbot at Berlin.de to gather a comprehensive dataset of user queries and corresponding responses related to Berlin's public administration services.
- Explore and integrate various open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Vicuna, Alpaca, Dolly2.0, Zicklein, and OpenAI's ChatGPT3.5 into the chatbot system.
- Develop a chatbot interface that can understand users' questions, interpret their intentions, and extract relevant context from the provided data sources.
- Implement a robust feedback mechanism to continuously improve the chatbot's performance over time based on user interactions and feedback.
- Ensure that the chatbot system provides reliable, up-to-date, and accurate information regarding various public administration processes, requirements, forms, and other relevant details.
